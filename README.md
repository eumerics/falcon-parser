# Falcon Parser

A blazing fast, memory efficient ECMAScript parser written in C and compiled to
WebAssembly. It is a standalone library with no dependencies and a lean code.
The library can be compiled to WebAssembly without the need for heavy toolchains
such as Emscripten. Hence the glue code required to load the WebAssembly code is
minimal.
